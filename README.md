# maladapt

#######MALADAPT PIPELINE#######
The development of MaLAdapt requires the following steps:

#1. Create simulations of archaic introgression as training data

	SLiM templates for three types of DFEs (additive, recessive, partial recessive) can be found in the slim/ directory

	Under the python/ directory, the following scripts should be used under the numeric order:
		1slim_simulations.py #create the simulations, extract features in 50kb overlapping windows
		2compile_simulations.py #combine all simulations from different DFE simulations into a large dataframe
		3adding_exon+r_info_simulations.py #add the separately computed exon density and recombination rate information to the aforementioned combined dataframe
		4downsample_class-ratio_simulations.py #downsample the non-AI class windows (2:1 ratio)

	For running the slim simulation from a bash script (UCLA hoffman2 cluster), a sample job script can be found in "sample_bash_command.sh"

	For the non-AI selective sweep simulations, the slim and python scripts can be found under the nonAIsweep/ directory in the slim/ directory

#2. Train MaLAdapt model
	
	The script used for training MaLAdapt can be found in the python/ directory ("5trainMaLAdapt.py")
	
	Features used in feature selection process can be found in the feature/ directory (with #4 being the ones used in the final version of MaLAdapt)


#3. Assessment of MaLAdapt performance under parameter-misspecified scenarios

	slim templates and python simulation scripts can be found in misspec_sims/ directory


#4. Apply MaLAdapt to the 1000 genomes human genomic data

	The empirical/ directory includes the python scripts used to compute features from 1KG populations, add the exon density/recombination rate features, and the application of MaLAdapt prediction

	All scripts should be used under the numeric order


#5. Additional files on Google Drive https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1HO-69dNA7Q_PIrBIStAx9W9Tv4fcr-Fp

	1. A pretrained model of MaLAdapt (published version in Zhang et al. 2023 MBE)
	2. 1000 genomic segments used in MaLAdapt training simulations
